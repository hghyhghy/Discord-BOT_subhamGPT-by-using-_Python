✌️ THE BOT CREATED BY ME ✌️

# CREATE _BOT _WITH _DISCORD_APP

WHAT IS A BOT? ✌️✌️
A bot is a software application that is programmed to do certain tasks. Bots are automated, which means they run according to their instructions without a human user needing to manually start them up every time. Bots often imitate or replace a human user's behavior. Typically they do repetitive tasks, and they can do them much faster than human users could.⏺️

⏺️WHAT IS DISCORD ?  ✌️✌️

Discord is a free app that combines the voice chat aspects of services like Skype and Teamspeak with the text chat aspects of Internet Relay Chat (IRC) and instant messaging services. Here's how to use the Discord app for Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and web browsers.⏺️

# It is used for Discord was made for online gamers as a free alternative to voice chat services like TeamSpeak, Mumble, and Ventrilo. These services facilitate Voice over IP (VoIP) communication between members of gaming clans, guilds, and other groups. Instead of using the voice communication tools built into games, which are often of lower quality and lack features, gamers use these services to play together.#
